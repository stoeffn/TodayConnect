#  TodayConnect—Up-to-Date on App Reviews and Ratings

Do you like having to log into _iTunesconnect_ every time you want to take a peek at your app's ratings or check if there are any new reviews to answer? Me neither.

This is why I build a today widget for the _macOS_ notification center that allows you to do just that.
