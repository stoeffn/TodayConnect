/// Wrapper around `URLSession` that allows simple and easy access to an API.
///
/// To use it, just create your own type, peferably an enumeration, implementing `ApiRoutes` and initialize an instance of this
/// class with your routes and a base `URL`.
///
/// You can use this class to make API requests, decode them automatically, and download files.
///
/// Depending on the `URLSession` given on initialization, this class uses the default `URLCredentialStorage`.
///
/// - Remark: This class is not marked `final` in order to allow subclassing for mock implementations. Usually, you will not
///           need to subclass it.
